Handed in date:  2/1/15

Source code file name(s): MyBoggle.java Trie.java SimpleDictionary.java
 






Other file name(s) (if relevant):







Does your program run without error?: It compiles and starts but runs into a null point exception

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?: Honestly at one point working on this assignment I had my project nearly functioning at 100% and
I made a few changes and was left with a  null pointer exception error that I could not figure out! I can guarantee
my search algorithm works correctly and I have both the simple and dlb versions implemented into my assignment, I just
have this null pointer that is restricting my program from running correctly. I feel like the error is very easy to
correct, I just can't get rid of it. I really hope partial credit is available because my algorithm is efficient and works well!
